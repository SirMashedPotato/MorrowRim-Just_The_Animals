    <MorrowRim_AshResistant_Description>Whether an animal is resistant to the effects of ash storms.\n\nIf an animal is resistant it will avoid all ash buildup when outside during an ash-storm.\n\nMechanoids, and other robotic constructs, may be resistant to ash buildup, but their servos may temporarily become clogged with ash.\n\nEven if an organic life-form is resistant to the affects of ash storms, it may occasionally suffer temporary blindness during one.</MorrowRim_AshResistant_Description>
    <MorrowRim_AshResistant_DescriptionPlant>Whether a plant is resistant to the effects of ash storms.\n\nIf a plant is not resistant it will slowly take damage during an ash storm, eventually killing the plant.</MorrowRim_AshResistant_DescriptionPlant>
